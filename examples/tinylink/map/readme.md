Due to making this game under heavy time constraints, I opted not to make or use a level editor. Instead, each object is assigned a color and I used a generic paint tool to design the levels.

Under normal circumstances, I would argue against this method and instead use something like Ogmo Editor or Tiled. It's really hard to remember what object is what color!
